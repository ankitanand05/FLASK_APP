## 🎓 Learning Path

- ✅ **Step 1**: Build Flask CRUD app (Current)
- ⏭️ **Step 2**: Set up GitHub repository
- ⏭️ **Step 3**: Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- ⏭️ **Step 4**: Deploy to AWS

## 🧪 Testing the App

Try these actions:
1. Add a new task with title "Learn Flask"
2. Add description "Build a CRUD application"
3. Mark it as complete
4. Add more tasks
5. Delete a task

## 💡 What You'll Learn

- Flask web framework basics
- Database operations with SQLAlchemy
- In-memory data structures
- RESTful API design
- GitHub Actions for automation
- AWS deployment strategies
- CI/CD pipeline concepts

## ⚠️ Note

This app uses **in-memory storage** which means all data is lost when the app restarts. This is perfect for learning CI/CD concepts without database complexity!
